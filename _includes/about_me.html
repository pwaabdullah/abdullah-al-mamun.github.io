            I'm a computer science PhD candidate at Florida International University, working at the Bioinformatics Research Group (<a href="http://biorg.cis.fiu.edu.html">BioRG</a>). I work on discovering molecular biomarkers from multi-omics cancer data under a deep learning framework. Also, applying various feature selection and data mining techniques on the gene expression, and study of dimensionality reduction algorithms like concrete autoencoder, SVM-RFE etc. Currently, on my second year, I have cleared PhD qualifying and candidacy exams have published several research articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.
